# Savannah-Psychic-Game-
This is a Psychic Game with a theme of the African Savannah. The object of the game is to guess the correct letter in 10 tries or less. If you dont guess right, then the lion will eat you! But if you guess right then you get to pass and go free. Good luck! 

just some notes abbout the games creation: 

I created an HTML file and internally linked my css file right into it. I did this beacuse my CSS was very short, and I felt it was easier to just connect it to my HTML markup page with a couple of <style> tags. 

I linked the Javascript file externally. I did this because it was a bigger file with much more syntax wrtten on it and I felt it made my html code too confuseing to read if I were to link my Javascript with my HTML code.   so insetad of useing HTML <script> tags i used an external link src. 

For the javascript portion of my game: 

1---first I set my global variables by useing the "let" command. 
2----next I created an array useing the square brackets, and in thoes square bracks I put all 26 lowercase letters of the alphabet. 
3---next I cretaed I a for loop
4--then i created a function, an event, and an alert at the end of the game with different messages based on if the user guess the correct letter. 
5---then I ate a good meal and took a nice nap because I was tired and it is saturday. 
have a good day!
